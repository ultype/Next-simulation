Version History

ATTENTION: Since V1.3.0.0 of the 2nd Stage Loader, parameters can only be 
           configured through the tag list using Hilscher Tag List Editor.
           Patching parameters using Bootwizard has been removed and is not
           supported anymore.

V1.4.17.1 (07.04.2015)
-----------------
Bugfix:
 - Firmware validation does not work on netX10/51/52 running in XiP/SQIROM mode,
   if no security memory is present and taglist entries for HW data are used
   (A wrong firmware may be downloaded and will illegally be started)

 - SD cards which do not respond to mandatory command CMD1 (SEND_OP_COND) are rejected
 - netX52: UART boot mode broken due to invalid default MMIO configuration
 - netX100/500: Error during license check may stall bootloader in startup phase
 - SD/MMC restore operation creates invalid short filename if extension of long filename has fewer than 3 characters
 - netX50/51/52: System channel signals system error although security memory is disabled via tag list
 - Restore operation creates corrupt files on target media if backup size exceeds target capacity

----------------------
 - Reduced maximum serial flash clock speeds for Winbond W25QXXX from 80 to 33 MHz in standard read mode

           ATTENTION: Wrong wiring may cause permanent hardware damage
 - netX52: Default USB ProductID is automatically adjusted to 0x200 if netX52 is being detected
 - SDHC/SDXC support added (may not work for all available cards, if they don't support SPI interface)
 - Boottoken list contains a broken token on hardwares without security memory,
   which results in a unparsable tokenlist

----------------------
Bugfix:
 - netX51 MMIO settings passed via taglist are not evaluated

V1.4.8.0 (06.02.2012)
---------------------
Changed:
 - netX10 DPM auto-detection changed to support serial DPM via DIRQ pin. See the
   following truth table:
       DIRQ   SIRQ    Mode
        0      X      Serial DPM (Mode 3)
        1      0      Parallel DPM (16 Bit)
        1      1      Parallel DPM (8 Bit)

V1.4.7.0 (16.01.2012)
---------------------
Bugfix:
 - Firmwares ending on a cluster boundary (filesize is a multiple of cluster size)
   are not started.

V1.4.6.0 (16.12.2011)
---------------------
Changed:
 - Disable USB at start to allow host to detect disconnection during restart
 - MRAM data is now inserted into System Status Block of DPM

Bugfix:
 - MRAM may not be mapped correctly

V1.4.5.0 (06.12.2011)
---------------------
Added:
 - Mapping of PCI target 2 (MRAM on 2nd memory bar)
 - netX10: USB communication changed to prevent FIFO problems (now using special protocol over USB).
   ATTENTION: This needs a special USB Driver (netx10ser.sys V6.0.2.0 or later)

V1.4.4.0 (16.09.2011)
---------------------
Bugfix:
 - netX10: Host interrupt was not correctly enabled for DPM Targets.
 - netX10: Host handshake cells were not zeroed correctly on system start (NSF_RESET)
 - netX10: Backup Partition did not work in SQIROM Mode
 - netX10: SDRAM Parameters from Taglist may not be used, depending on tag list element order
           (HIF and SDRAM depend on each other)
 - Bootloader update on SQI Flashes that don't support Page Erase does not work

Changed:
 - netX10: Generic 2nd Stage Loader binary now always uses SQIROM mode 
           (pre-activated in taglist)

V1.4.3.0 (14.09.2011)
---------------------
Added:
 - BOOTTOKEN_HARDWARE_FLAGS_CUSTOM_MMIO_MAPPING is now passed to firmware in 
   Boottoken BOOTTOKEN_HARDWARE_FLAGS, to tell the firmware a custom MMIO
   mapping has already been setup by 2nd Stage Loader and Firmware does not
   need to change it again

Bugfix:   
 - netX50 may erroneously detect a break signal on fiber-optics hardware
   and enters serial boot mode instead of starting the firmware or correctly 
   returning from a system reset via DPM

 - netX50 UART does not work if Fast-Startup mode is not enabled due to wrong
   MMIO configuration

Changed
 - UART is now checked for incoming transport packets in main loop. This allows
   to talk via UART with the 2nd Stage Loader even without asserting a break signal
   at coldstart
   ATTENTION: If a connection established via UART/USB/DPM all other connections
              will be disabled. This means if a connection via UART is established
              no access via DPM or USB will be possible until device being reset

V1.4.2.0 (11.08.2011)
---------------------
Changed:
 - All DPM Windows are now disable before firmware is started. This makes sure that the firmware
   can use the internal RAM for code/data completely, without the host destroying program code,
   before new DPM mapping is set up
 - USB core is now always disabled before firmware is started
 - AIFX now read with 4kHz
 - netX10 DPM timings updated for comX compatibility

Added:
 - RCX_FORMAT_REQ added to format flash disk
 - Restore from SD/MMC card will restore files to serial flash disk,
   even when default medium is set to par. flash.
 - new MMIO pinning for fast startup added (selectable via Tag List Editor)
 - Support for SPI flash Numonyx M45PE16
 - Support for Backup Partition (netX50/100, or netX10 with SDRAM). Currently not supported for netX10 SQIROM Mode

Bugfix:
 - 2nd Stage Loader may write to flash when booting a firmware
 - Creating default filesystem may fail after first reset (yellow LED permanent on)

V1.4.1.0 (22.11.2010)
---------------------
Bugfix:
 - SDRAM Parameters from TAG List may be ignored
 - Parallel Flash mode was always expecting a XiP Firmware
 - AIFX Modules may not work correctly

Changed:
 - Reset SYSTIME unit to power on defaults for netX10
 - Reducing MAX Frequency of AT45DB642D to 25/33MHz as 50MHz does not work on every HW design

V1.4.0.0 (26.10.2010)
---------------------
 Added:
  - netX10 support
  - MMIO configuration added to Taglist
  - USB descriptor added to Taglist

-------------------
 Added:
  - HilFileHeader V3 included 
  - PCI support (cifX, .NFX files only)
  - RAM Based device support (when no flash is available)
    This feature needs the cifX Toolkit which downloads all neccessary files at runtime

	- SD/MMC update support added (can be used to restore the flash file system)
  
 Changed:

    the serial console if the break signal goes away within 100ms after sending a zero character
  - SDRAM Parameter usage order changed
     1. Crypto flash (always used if available)
     2. Bootloader header (only used when no cryptoflash is available)
     3. .NXF file header (only used when neither crypto nor bootheader contains SDRAM information)

V0.913 (04.12.2008)
-------------------
 Changed:
  - Bootheaders user parameter is now evaluated and used to disable bootloader interfaces
    It contains a mask of disabled interfaces
     * 0x01 = UART
     * 0x02 = USB
     * 0x04 = HIF 
 Bugfix:
  - Cryptoflash read/write does expect inverted data anymore, so the user can just pass
  	the raw data structure (as described in manual)
  - Cryptoflash write did not work (wrong buffer was written)
  - Download in extended Mailbox did only use the first 80 byte chunks for data transfer 
 Added:

  - Buffer overflow in Serial/USB communication fixed
  - Bootloader did not enter HIF mode, if first host action was a Reset via DPM
  - USB connection was only checked once, and entered HIF Boot mode afterwards.
  - Reading crypto flash always returned invalid CRC, causing SDRAM Parameters can only be used from NXF file
    and not from crypto.
  - DPMAS_IFCONF1 was not written correctly for standard configuration
  - Removed incompatible serial Flash types (which do not support "page erase" or "page erase and program" opcode
  - USB did abort packet transfer due to internal core problems
  
 Changed:
  - Per Default only GPIO0 (netx100/500) or MMIO34 (netX50) is placed in Uart RXD state. 
    TXD/(GPIO1 or MMIO35) is only enabled, if a break signal is detected on the serial line. 
    GPIO2/3 or MMIO36/37) (CTS/RTS) are never used
  - Only try to read crypto flash license codes, if it was detected before
  - Changed Name to "Second Stage Loader (netX100/500)" and "Second Stage Loader (netX50)"

  * netX50

   is larger than mailbox/block size
 - Extended Mailbox did not work, as it internally expected 16 Bit Handshake cells

WAIT_DRV        1 : Push/pull output
WAIT_MODE       0 : WAIT / BUSY mode function. A active signal shows the the host system that the current access is not ready.
WAIT_POLARITY   0 : low active polarity output
IRQ_MODE        2 : Push / pull output
IRQ_POLARITY    0 : low active polarity output
